**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The Gaming Room is a client of the fictional company CTS working with them to develop a game “Draw it or Lose it,” loosely based on the popular 80s game “Win, Lose, or Draw.” They had a mobile application and wanted to branch out to more users via a web-based application. 
<br>
**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
I presented the client with detailed information regarding the pros and cons of web-based development, vs native applications, and purely mobile driven such as iOS and Android. I was as thorough as possible, indicating that use of a web-based application, using cloud-services for real-time updates for games, would save them the most time and effort. Games such as theirs require not much more than user verification and current games states. As such, a cloud-based application would allow for less work for their team with the scalability of cloud-computing. 
<br>
**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
When developing the code, the UML Diagram was extremely useful, it worked as well as Kanban cards, which in my experience saves a ton of time. Knowing what variables needed to be private, public, etc., saved a lot of headaches when coding. I was able to write efficiently and focus on the pattern at hand. 
<br>
**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
The design document itself was a bit lacking on my part in the beginning as writing design documents was new to me. I was able to go back and fix my executive summary and add other details onto the table, and more specific as the demands and needs changed for the company. Moreover, if I were to do a design document in the future, I would consider as many specifics in the beginning as possible, while also maintaining an idea of flexibility, such as would be in a Scrum/Agile environment. 
<br>
**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
I carefully read the users requests. They only had a mobile application before coming to CTS to ask us to write a web-based application and to get our recommendation for the best approach. We design software for a client and that client’s end-users, or their clientele, depend on that software. Without considering the needs of the client, we ignore their business needs, and work on things that they do not need or could cost the developers more money and time simply by wasting resources and time on something the client does not need. Efficiency is key, and in the end software development is a business, return on investment includes the hours spent working on projects. Many times, projects will shift, or be thrown out completely, so if a ton of time is wasted on features that are not even needed because business needs were not considered, it could cost the developers money and time. 
<br>
**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
Designing the software I strictly stayed within the confines of what was asked, using specific design patterns, and adhering to best practices. I think the use of Kanban cards, or a system like it, can do wonders to save time and energy for a project. Going forward, I will consider UML diagrams as well as it is yet another way to organize and get the bigger picture before breaking it down into smaller parts. Design considers the overall project, and implementation is a step at a time, so all things need to be considered for a solid foundation and follow through on any project.
